\begin{abstract}
R evaluates function arguments lazily. When a function is called the formal
parameters are bound to ``promises'' Arguments are stored in ``promises''
which are ``forced'' when the corresponding parameter is used in an evaluation context. A
promise also contains a reference to the environment in which the argument has
to be evaluated and a slot to cache the result of evaluation.  This mechanism
can potentially improve speed of R programs by preventing the evaluation of
arguments that are not used. However, benchmarks obtained by instrumenting the R
interpreter indicate that lazy evaluation is futile for majority of R programs
and detrimental for their performance. R has a functional core and even most the
basic control structures are implemented as functions. This results in the
creation of a huge number of promises which get forced immediately but continue
storing the unevaluated arguments until they are garbage collected. Furthermore,
accessing the argument's value requires the promise to look up the cache which
introduces a level of indirection, increasing the possibility of cache misses.

%% TODO - Why is evaluation order important?

In this paper, we present a static analysis technique on an intermediate
representation of R code that identifies the promises that are forced and the
order in which they are forced. This information can then be used by an
optimizer to prevent the creation of promises and evaluate arguments in the
correct order, ensuring unchanged program behavior. We validate the results of
our static analysis from dynamic runs on a number of widely used R libraries.

A promise object has three slots; value, expression and environment. When a
function is called, the actual arguments are wrapped inside promises. The
promise also contains a reference to the
